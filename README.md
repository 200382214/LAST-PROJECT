Lucid Chat is a functional messaging app capable of one-on-one (private).

(The app enables users to send text). We have used firebase for Authentication and Storing data because it is most integrated cloud so far with Android.

We have Four Activities which allows to navigate to any other activity very easily


 ## Registration Activity
_This will be first activity which will be displayed after the app is launch. The user can create a new account and if he/she already has an account than they can navigate to Login Activity and Login themselves_

## Login Activity
_Allows users to login with the existing account_

## Chat Activity
_This activity will show us the list of all the chat that the user might have done so far._

## Latest Message Activity
_When the user clicks on the single chat person then it will navigate to this activity which provides all the private, they have done so far._
